        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>
            The rules of the NBL-USA are rules from USA Basketball Youth Development for grades 9-12 (high school), which are based from FIBA, basketball's
            international governing body. Our official game ball is a red, white and blue basketball, in paying respect for the legacy of the American Basketball Association from 1967 to 1976.
            For more information on the USA Basketball Youth Development rules for grades 9-12 (high school) and FIBA rules, please click the buttons below. For fun fact, you can

        <h2>Eligibility</h2>
        <p>Players must be 19 years old and under and have amateur status.  We comply with the NCAA's Amateurism clearinghouse so that the player would be eligible to play in the NCAA.
        However, players upon completing high school and eligibilty of this league are still eligible to turn professional, including the NBA.  For more information
        regarding the NCAA's amateurism, please click below.</p>

        <h2>Academic Advising and Billet (Host) Parenting</h2>
        <p>Though most of the teams in the NBL-USA are not school-affiliated, all of the players are still considered Student-Athletes.
        Each team will have an Academic Advisor, to ensure that the players remain academically eligible to continue to play and provide tutoring if players
        are struggling.  However, any aid in performing schoolwork, or testing for the players, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED!! AND THAT TEAM WILL FACE
        MAJOR CONSEQUENCES FROM THE NBL-USA AND NCAA ELIGIBILITY WOULD BE COMPROMISED!!  Billet Parenting is a very noble voluntary duty.  Anyone
        interested in Billet Parenting will be subject to criminal background checks and home inspection by the league to ensure that the players
        will be housed in a safe, comfortable and stable environment. For more information in Billet Parenting, which is on a junior hockey team
        website, please click below.</p>
